This project was completed as a midterm assignment for my data journalism class.

The data and analysis performed here is based on the 2012 Sun Sentinel reporting that found cops were among Florida's worst speeders. 

The data used in this report is a recreation of the work the Sun Sentinel reporters did for that story. Sun Sentinel only posted an abbreviated part of the data used in their analysis, so the numbers found in this report differ from the 2012 final article. 

The data used for this report is limited and does not reflect any real-world scenario. It was completed for academic purposes as a class assignment.
